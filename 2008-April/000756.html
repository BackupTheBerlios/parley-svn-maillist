-0. INTRODUCTION
-
-  Administering public forums is notoriously nightmarish.
-
-1. BAN TYPES
-
-  The ideas for slowing down Evil People are as follows:
-
-1.1 Account Suspension
-
-    When the account tries to log-in all they see is an &quot;Account Suspended&quot;
-    page.
-
-    The site can be viewed while logged out (i.e. guest user)
-
-1.2 Ban-by-IP
-
-    This can take varying levels of restriction:
-
-1.2.1 Restrict Posting by IP
-
-    Prevent user(s) from matching IPs creating new threads, replying to
-    existing threads or editing existing posts.
-
-1.2.2 Restrict Login by IP
-
-    Prevent user(s) from matching IPs using the login functionality
-
-1.2.3 Restrict Sign-Up by IP
-
-    Prevent new accounts being created from matching IPs
-
-1.2.4 Restrict All Access by IP
-
-    Matching IPs are shown the &quot;Evil People Got You Banned&quot; page.
-    This is pretty harsh, and should be saved as a ast resort .. if
-    implemented/used at all.
-
-2. KNOWN ISSUES
-
-  There are the usual issues of people running through proxies, catching
-  people we didn't intend to, or being used by banned users to circumvent IP
-  based bans.
-
-3. CONCERNS
-
-3.1 Performance
-
-    Will IP checking for every request have a noticable, negative, effect on
-    application performance?
-    We could store information in-session for IPs we discover to be affected,
-    but we then have the following issues:
-        - we're still doing a lookup every hit for the majority of hits (the
-          Good people)
-        - if we escalate or modify a user's IP restriction it won't take
-          effect, since we already have them session-flagged for something
-          lesser.
-
-4. POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATIONS
-
-4.1 Net::IP::Match::Regexp
-
-    This looks like a useful module for providing (CIDR - a.b.c.d/x) IP ranges
-    and matching IPs that live in those ranges.
-
-4.2 IP matching
-
-    In (3.1) concerns were raised regarding a per hit performance lookup.
-
-    This may be reduced by reducing the number of lookups and queries; instead
-    of a growing set of records in a table - one for each new match - we could
-    make use of the create_iprange_regexp() feature in Net::IP::Match::Regexp
-    and have one row for each ban-type.
-
-    This should reduce database overheads, and hopefully simplify the IP
-    matching.
-
-    The interface may become difficult to use (in the initial) implementation
-    if we offer a textarea to manage the ranges. This could be overcome in the
-    future by having the interface split/format IP blocks on viewing, and
-    compress to one string on saving.
-    A small hit at admin time, instead of a per-hit overhead.
-
-    We'd lose the ability to timestamp individual modifications, or provide a
-    per-block rejection message.
-
-4.3 Admin Action Tracking
-
-    It would be useful for the application to keep a log of changes, with a
-    comment written by the moderator, so that time and reasons for bans could
-    be viewed by other admins.
-
-    e.g.
-
-      2008-02-13 08:25  Added r.s.t.u/x - they just kept on being abusive
-
-    There might be an opportunity to establish the &quot;diff&quot; between the before
-    and after IP list(s) and store those with the message. (list based maths?)
-
-4.4 Admin permissions and roles
-
-    We don't necessarily wish to allow all moderators the ability to perform
-    anoy or all of the restriction actions.
-
-    This will most likely introduce some kind of role based system;
-    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles?
-
-    Methods can be added to ::Schema::Person to do various role checks;
-    e.g.  can_suspend_account()
-    [although, how can we use the Catalyst plugin be used from the Schema?]

-PERL
-
-Gravatar implementations with PERL are pretty straightforward, however you do
-need to include several external libraries. These are probably already
-installed on your machine, but if they're not, you'll have to download and
-install them.
-
-Let's start by including those library functions that we'll utilize:
-
-use URI::Escape qw(uri_escape);
-use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);
-
-Next, assume the following variables are available to you:
-
-my $email = &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/parley-svn">someone at somewhere.com</A>&quot;;
-my $default = &quot;<A HREF="http://www.somewhere.com/homsar.jpg">http://www.somewhere.com/homsar.jpg</A>&quot;;
-my $size = 40;
-
-You can construct your gravatar url with the following PERL code:
-
-my $grav_url = &quot;<A HREF="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?">http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?</A>
-gravatar_id=&quot;.md5_hex($email).
-&quot;&amp;default=&quot;.uri_escape($default).
-&quot;&amp;size=&quot;.$size;
-
-This only constructs the URL, so don't forget to place it in an img tag before
-printing it.
